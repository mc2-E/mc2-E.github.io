## About the Lab
We develop multiscale and multi-physics models, reduced-order models, and AI/ML tools, to understand and engineer nuclear and energy materials.  
Our work spans:
- Multiphysics & multiscale modeling of materials in extreme environments 
- AI/ML-driven reduced-order models for materials properties and performance   
- Advanced nuclear fuels, claddings, and structural materials for advanced reactors
- Materials for Fusion Energy
- Battery Materials    

## Website Structure
- `index.md` – Homepage  
- `_pages/` – Research, Teaching, People, Publications, News  
- `_posts/` – News & blog entries (Markdown files with date-based filenames)  


## How to Contribute
